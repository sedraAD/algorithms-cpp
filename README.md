# Algorithms and Data Structures (C++)

This repository contains implementations of algorithms and data structures written in C++ as part of university laboratory assignments.

The code in this repository focuses on implementing the core logic of each algorithm and data structure rather than providing complete runnable programs.

## Contents

The repository includes implementations of:

- Searching algorithms such as linear search and binary search (including recursive variants)
- Sorting algorithms such as selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort and heap sort
- Fundamental data structures including stacks, queues, heaps, priority queues, ordered lists and indexed lists (Labb B)
- Graph-related implementations including graph representation and disjoint set (union-find)

## Notes

- The files are laboratory implementations and are not designed to be run as standalone applications
- There is no main program or executable provided

## Technologies Used

- C++
- Algorithms and Data Structures

## Author

Implementation by Sedra Abou Daher - Datastrukturer och algoritmer - DV1662
